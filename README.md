Custom Daemon for ADB

This daemon allows you to execute commands as the shell user on Android directly from Termux or any other local shell emulator.

ðŸ§­ Setup Instructions

1. Enable ADB debugging:

Enable Wireless Debugging or use USB debugging.

Get a shell on the device via adb shell (e.g. from PC or self-connection app like shizuku/self-connect).



2. Copy daemon into place:

Clone this repository into /sdcard.

Inside your adb shell:

cp -r /sdcard/Custom-daemon-for-adb/* /data/local/tmp
cd /data/local/tmp
./daemon_launcher

Exit the ADB shell.

Turn off Wireless Debugging if you enabled it.

Daemon_call() {
  echo "$*" > /sdcard/su
  sleep 0.4
  cat /sdcard/suOutput
  rm /sdcard/suOutput
}

Then simply invoke commands:

Daemon_call whoami
Daemon_call am start -n com.some.app/.Activity
